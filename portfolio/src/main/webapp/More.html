        <h3>This is a picture of a seagull.</h3>
        <p> Seagulls are my second favorite
            type of bird. This particular seagull is <i>french</i>; we'll call him
            Louis. I found Louis at Le Mont-Saint-Michel. He posed for my picture.

        <h3>Which Bird is the Best?</h3>
        <p>To solve this argument we looked at bird species in Boulder, Colorado.
            For each catagory of bird (gull, duck and woodpecker), we graphed the number of
            species that have been spotted in Boulder. For example,
            the American Wigeon is a species of duck that has been seen in sparse pairs
            around Boulder County.
        </p>
        <p>According to the chart below, it looks like ducks are the 
            best bird by far. Let us know in the comments if you disagree.

        <h3>The Countries with the Most Birds</h3>
        <p>To dive a little deeper into this bird research, we looked at the total number of bird species
            per country. You can see the total number of bird species for any country as of July 2019 
            <a href="https://rainforests.mongabay.com/03birds.htm">here</a>.
        <p>
        <p>From this data we can conclude that the best country for bird watching is Colombia with the #1
            species count at 1,878. That's a lot of birds.
