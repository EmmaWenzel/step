      <h1>My(Emma's) Portfolio</h1>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
          My name is Emma Wenzel; I'm a STEP intern with Google for summer 2020. 
          Starting in August, I'll be a sophomore at the University of Colorado
          Boulder. I like acting and rock climbing, and I'm currently watching 
          Avatar for the first time. 
      </p>
      <p>So far in my academic career, I've taken intro to programming, data
          structures and discrete structures. My strongest language is c++, but I
          can also code in Python and I'm learning JavaScript and HTML now!
      </p>
      <p>Here is a list of projects I've worked on:</p>
      <dl>
          <dt>DNA Sequence Project</dt>
          <dd>This was my first project in c++; we learned to use string comparison. 
              You can find this project in 
              <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-wenzel-67b929155/detail/treasury/education:617213860/?entity

              section=education%3A617213860&treasuryCount=2">my LinkedIn</a>.</dd>
          <dt>Pokemon Project</dt>
          <dd>This was my final project for intro to computing. We
               used classes and arrays to create a Pokemon Game in the terminal.</dd>
            <dt>Star Crossed Voyagers: The Crystal Conundrum</dt>
          <dd>Star Crossed Voyagers is a text based game in the terminal I created with a partner for the T9
               hackathon this year. We won best beginner hackers! You can find this project in
                <a href="https://github.com/EmmaWenzel/StarCrossedVoyagers-TheCrystalConundrum">my GitHub</a>.</dd>
            <dt>Data Structures Project</dt>
          <dd>This was my final project in data structures where we compared linked lists, binary trees, 
                graphs and hash tables. I completed this project with the same partner as Star Crossed Voyagers 
                (Allison Palmer, what a gal).</dd>

           This is a picture of a seagull. 
      </h3>
      <p> Seagulls are my second favorite
           type of bird. This particular seagull is french; we'll call him
           Louis. I found Louis at Le Mont-Saint-Michel. He posed for my picutre.
