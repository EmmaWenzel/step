        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Emma Wenzel; I'm a STEP intern with Google for summer 2020. 
            Starting in August, I'll be a sophomore at the University of Colorado
            Boulder. I like acting and rock climbing, and I'm currently watching 
            Avatar for the first time. 
          </p>
          <p> 
            So far in my academic career, I've taken intro to programming, data
            structures and discrete structures. My strongest language is C++, but I
            can also code in Python and I'm learning JavaScript and HTML now!
          </p>
